# T-72B1-GHPC-Mod

This mod was created in close collaboration with Atlas, Github: TheBeninator.
Use of any aspect of this mod is not for use in the development of any other mod unless permissed by the creator.
How to install:

1. Requires MelonLoader, instructions for download here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbIHolAu5CE at roughly 0:34
2. Download the latest release (Watch for updates, they're frequent.)
3. Drop the .dll in the mod folder of your GHPC game.

This mod will replace every T-72M1 with a T-72B, keep in mind that the model is unable to be changed at the moment, so you will need to use your imagination for now.
For questions, contact me in the GHPC discord @SwissAdmiral.
